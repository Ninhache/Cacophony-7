Hey, that's a simple test to try Symfony 7

Since I'm comming from Java and Quarkus, I'm pretty familiar with all the stuff I'm seeing.. butt they're maybe not the best practices..

Since I just want to try Symfony 7.. the project looks a bit like a Garbage can, but that's fine i guess.. this is working.. ahem

cheers
